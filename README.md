# GCD-of-two-8-bit-Numbers-
This project involves the implementation of an 8-bit GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) calculator using the Euclidean algorithm on the Altera DE2 FPGA. The GCD is the largest positive integer that divides two given integers without leaving a remainder, making it a fundamental operation in number theory with applications in cryptography, coding theory, and computer algebra systems.The Euclidean algorithm is utilized for its efficiency, repeatedly replacing the larger of the two numbers with the remainder of their division until the remainder becomes zero, at which point the other number is the GCD. This project was implemented on the Altera DE2 FPGA board to achieve fast, reliable, and resource-efficient GCD computation in hardware, making it a practical module for systems requiring efficient integer arithmetic operations.
